# DeepCloner For Unity

## About
**DeepCloner For Unity** is a support library for easy shallow and deep copying of C# .Net objects in Unity. It is a fork of the original **DeepCloner** library that has additional support for ensuring `UnityEngine` type or derived type members on an object are assigned rather than shallow or deep-copied as many of these cannot be instantiated through plain C# construction.

## Installing DeepClonerForUnity
Using this library in your project can be done in three ways:

### Install via OpenUPM
The package is available on the [openupm registry](https://openupm.com/). It's recommended to install it via [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli).

```
openupm add com.jeffcampbellmakesgames.deepclonerforunity
```

### Install via GIT URL
Using the native Unity Package Manager introduced in 2017.2, you can add this library as a package by modifying your `manifest.json` file found at `/ProjectName/Packages/manifest.json` to include it as a dependency. See the example below on how to reference it.

```
{
	"dependencies": {
		...
		"com.jeffcampbellmakesgames.deepclonerforunity" : "https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/DeepClonerForUnity.git#release/stable",
		...
	}
}
```


You will need to have Git installed and available in your system's PATH.

### Install via classic `.UnityPackage`
The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/DeepClonerForUnity/releases) as a UnityPackage file that can be downloaded and imported directly into your project's Assets folder.
