## NOTE: This project is provided as-is as I have not been able to get all use-cases covered for AOT/il2cpp platforms (see [here](https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/Entitas-Redux/issues/18) for more details). I'd like to pursue this at some point again once either more support for dynamic code generation is available on these platforms (for Unity) or if I get inspired to pursue this again via a different avenue or set of contraints. If interested in helping, please reach out!

# DeepCloner For Unity

## About
**DeepCloner For Unity** is a support library for easy shallow and deep copying of C# .Net objects in Unity. It is a fork of the original **DeepCloner** library that has additional support for ensuring `UnityEngine` type or derived type members on an object are assigned rather than shallow or deep-copied as many of these cannot be instantiated through plain C# construction.

## Requirements
* Unity 2019.4 LTS or greater
* If using `il2cpp`, you must include the following snippet below in your `link.xml` file to prevent this assembly from being stripped, otherwise `DeepCloner` functionality will fail when attempted to be used at runtime (though it will compile).

```xml
<linker>
	<assembly fullname="System.Core">
		<type fullname="System.Linq.Expressions.Interpreter.LightLambda" preserve="all" />
	</assembly>
</linker>
```

## Support
If this is useful to you and/or youâ€™d like to see future development and more tools in the future, please consider supporting it either by contributing to the Github projects (submitting bug reports or features and/or creating pull requests) or by buying me coffee using any of the links below. Every little bit helps!
